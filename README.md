# Violent Python Examples

My take on the examples from the book [Violent Python by O`Connor, T][3]. 

### Setup
#### Environments
For the attacker machine, I recommend using [Kali Linux][4] - possibly in VirtualBox.

For the target machine, I recommend running [Metasploitable 2][5] in VirtualBox. *The Metasploitable virtual machine is an intentionally vulnerable version of Ubuntu Linux designed for testing security tools and demonstrating common vulnerabilities.*

#### Python
The code is written for Python 2.x.

Install the required packages by running:

    $ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
